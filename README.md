# Hi, I'm Mesula Korsa 👋

### Data Science & Analytics Enthusiast • PhD-Trained Researcher • Power BI Reporting

I’m a PhD‑trained researcher currently working as a **Document Controller Manager and Power BI reporter**, building a pathway into **data science** and **academic roles**.  
I enjoy working with structured information, ensuring accuracy, and creating clarity from complex datasets and documentation systems.

My PhD strengthened my **analytical thinking**, **data‑driven decision-making**, **critical analysis**, and **scientific reporting skills**. I now apply these strengths directly to document management and data workflows — ensuring everything I handle is **organised, traceable, accurate, and decision‑ready**.

I’m actively expanding my skills into **data science and analytics** through structured learning, practical projects, and continuous improvement.
